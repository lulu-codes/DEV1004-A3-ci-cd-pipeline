# CI WORKFLOW: CI Pull Request Tests & Validation Checks
# PURPOSE: Runs lint and backend and frontend tests when a PR is opened to main to validate quality before merging into main.
# RESULTS: If any check fails, PR is blocked from merging, otherwise PR is allowed to merge.
# TRIGGER: pull_request to main branch, or workflow_dispatch for manual run.
